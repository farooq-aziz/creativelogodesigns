It is only the turnaround time for a single iteration of the development stage. Depending on the kind of service, the time required for revisions could vary from a minimum of 48 hours to 72 hours which means two working days.

                                    Refund is processed for the orders placed in good faith.

In such a case, we reserve the right to decline a refund request.

                                    For example, if you order web design and video animation services and approve the website, you can claim a refund for the video animation service before designing the storyboard only.

                                    A refund request will need to have a valid reason to support it, which must qualify against the website brief and customer feedback for revisions. Unless a layout has not been designed according to the brief, a refund will not be processed; however, further revisions will be provided until complete satisfaction.
